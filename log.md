# 100 Days Of Code Log - [K. Marie Brown](https://github.com/KMarieBrown)

## Day 1: Saturday, March 12, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 1 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (variables, constants, strings, and numbers) and Section 1 of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp (Getting Started with iOS Development and Swift 5).

**Thoughts:** Not bad for day 1. Having some programming experience, today's topics were more familiar to me than not. It's interesting to see the differences between languages. I particularly liked that we can use underscores for thousands in Swift, in order to read numbers clearer. I also like that Swift is a type safe language that keeps you from mixing different data types by accident.

## Day 2: Sunday, March 13, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 2 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (Booleans, string interpolation, and checkpoint 1) and began Section 2 of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp (Xcode Storyboards and Interface Builder).

**Thoughts:** Today was exciting. I am so happy Dr. Yu took us on a walkthrough of Xcode. It really reminds me of using Adobe Creative Cloud, so my creative senses are jumping happily. It was fun to start designing the UI, also. Swift, was fun to learn today, also. I liked working with string interpolation. I completed my tests with 100% scores and completed the checkpoint.

## Day 3: Monday, March 14, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 3 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (Arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums) and finished up Section 2 (Xcode Storyboards and Interface Builder) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** Today, I got confused and received a 9/12 score on the dictionary default values test. But, I know where I got turned around and understand it now. I scored 100: on all of the others. Todays lesson reminded me of the switch statement, arrays, objects and sets in JS. The similarities are certainly helpful. I also learned how to manipulate images in Xcode and run an app on the Simulator and iPhone.

## Day 4: Tuesday, March 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 4 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (type annotations and checkpoint 2) and after finishing a challenge, worked into section 4 (Swift Programming Basics - Collections, Constants & Variables) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** Today, was a good day. I understood the Swift lesson. It seemed to click pretty well. I love how Paul reiterates that you have to relearn things sometimes and that's how you learn. I completed the challenge pretty easily once I updated Xcode. And again, the design lessons in Udemy were pretty fun.

## Day 5: Wednesday, March 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 5 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (if, switch, and the ternary operator)
and continued on with section 4 (Swift Programming Basics - Collections, Constants & Variables) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** 100 Days of SwiftUI is really testing my attention to detail. I've had positions in the past where I've had to be meticulous (I pride myself on it). So, I'm being extra careful to try not to get fooled while quickly going through the tests. I enjoyed Udemy's lesson, as per the usual. I had fun learning how to programmatically change my app's UI. I'm still on schedule per my study plan, so that's exciting. It's not always easy to predict the time needed for these lessons. Plus, I code along and sometimes take notes. Therefore, I almost always take longer than the stated time to finish a video

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
