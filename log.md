# 100 Days Of Code Log - [K. Marie Brown](https://github.com/KMarieBrown)

## Day 1: Saturday, March 12, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 1 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (variables, constants, strings, and numbers) and Section 1 of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp (Getting Started with iOS Development and Swift 5).

**Thoughts:** Not bad for day 1. Having some programming experience, today's topics were more familiar to me than not. It's interesting to see the differences between languages. I particularly liked that we can use underscores for thousands in Swift, in order to read numbers clearer. I also like that Swift is a type safe language that keeps you from mixing different data types by accident.

**Link(s) to work:** n/a.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
