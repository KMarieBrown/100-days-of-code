# 100 Days Of Code Log - [K. Marie Brown](https://twitter.com/KMarieBrown)

## Day 1: Saturday, March 12, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 1 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (variables, constants, strings, and numbers) and Section 1 of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp (Getting Started with iOS Development and Swift 5).

**Thoughts:** Not bad for day 1. Having some programming experience, today's topics were more familiar to me than not. It's interesting to see the differences between languages. I particularly liked that we can use underscores for thousands in Swift, in order to read numbers clearer. I also like that Swift is a type safe language that keeps you from mixing different data types by accident.

## Day 2: Sunday, March 13, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 2 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (Booleans, string interpolation, and checkpoint 1) and began Section 2 of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp (Xcode Storyboards and Interface Builder).

**Thoughts:** Today was exciting. I am so happy Dr. Yu took us on a walkthrough of Xcode. It really reminds me of using Adobe Creative Cloud, so my creative senses are jumping happily. It was fun to start designing the UI, also. Swift, was fun to learn today, also. I liked working with string interpolation. I completed my tests with 100% scores and completed the checkpoint.

## Day 3: Monday, March 14, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 3 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (Arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums) and finished up Section 2 (Xcode Storyboards and Interface Builder) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** Today, I got confused and received a 9/12 score on the dictionary default values test. But, I know where I got turned around and understand it now. I scored 100: on all of the others. Todays lesson reminded me of the switch statement, arrays, objects and sets in JS. The similarities are certainly helpful. I also learned how to manipulate images in Xcode and run an app on the Simulator and iPhone.

## Day 4: Tuesday, March 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 4 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (type annotations and checkpoint 2) and after finishing a challenge, worked into section 4 (Swift Programming Basics - Collections, Constants & Variables) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** Today, was a good day. I understood the Swift lesson. It seemed to click pretty well. I love how Paul reiterates that you have to relearn things sometimes and that's how you learn. I completed the challenge pretty easily once I updated Xcode. And again, the design lessons in Udemy were pretty fun.

## Day 5: Wednesday, March 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 5 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (if, switch, and the ternary operator)
and continued on with section 4 (Swift Programming Basics - Collections, Constants & Variables) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** 100 Days of SwiftUI is really testing my attention to detail. I've had positions in the past where I've had to be meticulous (I pride myself on it). So, I'm being extra careful to try not to get fooled while quickly going through the tests. I enjoyed Udemy's lesson, as per the usual. I had fun learning how to programmatically change my app's UI. I'm still on schedule per my study plan, so that's exciting. It's not always easy to predict the time needed for these lessons. Plus, I code along and sometimes take notes. Therefore, I almost always take longer than the stated time to finish a video

## Day 6: Thursday, March 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 6 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (loops, summary, and checkpoint 3) and continued on with section 4 (Swift Programming Basics - Collections, Constants & Variables) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** In the checkpoint for 100 Days of SwiftUI, Paul mentioned that the challenge had been used in interviews. I hope I can figure out interview questions the way I was able to work this problem out. I enjoyed this lesson. Although, the while loops test felt like it tricked me more times than I would like. I plan to go through it again tomorrow. The tests are great. The way they're set up, I feel like I'm debugging. The Udemy course also had challenges that were used in interviews. I appreciate these exercises a lot.

## Day 7: Friday, March 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 7 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (functions, parameters, and return values).

**Thoughts:** Life attempted to interrupt me today. It distracted me long enough to have to skip my Udemy lesson plan for tonight. However, I did complete and mostly understand the SwiftUI lesson for today. I only have a question on 1-2 things after taking the tests, so that's good. I wish it was full understanding, but I'll get there. I thought about joining a BootCamp today, mostly for the companionship and mentorship. But, it's not in the budget. I also thought a lot about the fact that I'm moving my focus from Web Development to iOS Development and which would be best for my career. So many huge decisions. I'm sure many of us are contemplating the same questions. Stressing over needing a job in the meantime is quite distracting, too.

## Day 9: Saturday, March 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished section 4 (Swift Programming Basics - Collections, Constants & Variables) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course and the videos for Day 8 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (default values, throwing functions, and checkpoint 4).

**Thoughts:** Udemy's course was a nice review to the things I've been learning in 100 Days of SwiftUI. I did need help for the challenge and still plan to read the documentation to be sure why one format is used in one situation and not another. But once I read the documentation, I should be fine. I let it get pretty late, so that's the only reason I'm not reading it right now.

## Day 10: Friday, March 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I worked on checkpoint 4 for Day 8 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (default values, throwing functions, and checkpoint 4).

**Thoughts:** I took a few days off. I was feeling burnt out and maybe should've taken a break in between my JavaScript studies and starting Swift. Additionally, I revamped my learning plan. I have decided to continue with the Udemy course and hold off on the 100 Days of SwiftUI tutorials for the time being. I think it may be more conducive to my learning style. I also included makeup and rest days into the plan. Although I'm doing the 100 Days of Code challenge, I believe it's healthy and gives your brain time to work with the information you've recently learned.

## Day 11: Sunday, March 27, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished section 5 (Swift Programming Basics Challenge) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed building the 8 Ball Challenge. Completing this challenge on my own was fun and helped build my confidence.

## Day 12: Monday, March 28, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started section 6 (Auto Layout and Responsive UIs) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** Today's modules were fun yet again. I'm going to enjoy them as much as I can. I know they will grow more and more difficult. I hope to enjoy the process the whole time. I learned about alignment & pinning, setting constraints and working with containers. I plan to review these tomorrow, because they're so important and I want to make sure I understand each of them.

## Day 13: Tuesday, March 29, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working in section 6 (Auto Layout and Responsive UIs) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I'm learning that when I have a hard time figuring out a problem it sometimes helps to sleep on it. Today, I worked on a new challenge, the Calculator/Auto Layout Boss Challenge, and I got really close to finishing at the end of the night. I literally had one line left to fix, but couldn't think of the trick to get itd right. I was proud of my progress, anyway, and called it a night.

## Day 14: Wednesday, March 30, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed section 6 (Auto Layout and Responsive UIs) and began section 7 (Using and Understanding Apple Documentation) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course. I'm now caught up on my new learning plan.

**Thoughts:** I am so happy that she went through Stack Overflow the way she did. Who knew that I even needed that type of explanation. Angela is so patient and gives great tips. I'm really enjoying this course. We started with functions and I'm looking forward to how she teaches the more deeper concepts of them.

## Day 15: Thursday, March 31, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed section 7 (Using and Understanding Apple Documentation) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I appreciate all of the challenges that are built into this course. It really helps to reinforce what I've just learned. I'm proud of myself for what I've learned and where I am in my understanding. I am implementing Angela's 5 step approach to problem solving programming problems and although reading the docs is a still a tad bit fuzzy, I know I'll get better at it. I will also get better at treating challenges more like a game or puzzle that needs to be solved. I ended up utilizing the Q&A for one part of the coding exercise. Strangely, I felt duped after seeing the solution. I'll get there-I'm pressing forward.

## Day 16: Friday, April 1, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started section 8 (Intermediate Swift Programming - Control Flow and Optionals) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I learned a cool way to code whether or not a year is a leap year. I finished the coding exercise, but need to finish setting up the function for the Egg Timer Project. I got stuck and once again, I'm sure I'm missing something simple. I'll think it through and try again tomorrow. It was also a nice review of the If-Else Statement. One thing I learned is that I know how to solve the problem with code, but I absolutely have to work out what is being asked of me. Sometimes, that's the tricky part.

## Day 17: Saturday, April 2, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on section 8 (Intermediate Swift Programming - Control Flow and Optionals) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I'm doing well with challenges today. I'm looking up and mostly understanding the documentation for items I'm unfamiliar with. I worked on Switch Statements and Dictionaries. I had a thought today that I've never had so much fun making mistakes before. Let the learning, mistakes and fun continue.

## Day 18: Tuesday, April 5, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on section 8 (Intermediate Swift Programming - Control Flow and Optionals) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I didn’t get as much done today as I wanted, but I’m super proud of the way I completed each challenge. I feel like my brain is really starting to train itself to think like a dev.

## Day 19: Wednesday, April 6, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed section 8 (Intermediate Swift Programming - Control Flow and Optionals) and started section 9 (iOS App Design Patters and Code Structuring) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I worked on 2D Arrays and learned a 5 step approach to debug apps. I like how she explained the Arrays, but I'll have to use them more to commit them to memory. I also feel more equipped with her 5 step approach, but I need to work more on step 3 (What does your expectation depend on). I'm not sure I'm understanding it the way it is explained. I need to put it in my own words. I also completed an egg timer and a quizzer project. It was a somewhat productive day.

## Day 20: Friday, April 8, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on section 9 (iOS App Design Patters and Code Structuring) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:**  I learned about structures, methods and properties. I think Dr. Yu did a great job of explaining these and I'm actually excited to use them. I can see that they'll be useful in coding. And it's very likely that she's added lots of practice in the upcoming modules.

## Day 21: Saturday, April 9, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on section 9 (iOS App Design Patters and Code Structuring) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I started off a little rusty-brained today, but I kept going and things started to click. I started working on the MVC Design Pattern and implementing it into my Quizzler Project. I will just take this slowly and make sure I understand what code we're moving and why.

## Day 22: Sunday, April 10, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed section 9 (iOS App Design Patters and Code Structuring) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** Today was tough. I feel like my head is full of information, but it's floating around in an unorganized way. It's just all jumbled. I need to review this module and maybe a bit of the previous module. In the past, I just kept moving forward, because I was trying to learn in a "respectable" amount of time. This is the time that I set for myself, mind you. I'm sure that led to more frustrations and burnout. I'll take my time with this. I hope the payoff is huge in the end. Because, I'm making a lot of sacrifices the longer I take to learn and get a job.

## Day 23: Friday, April 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed sections 8 (function sections) and section 9 (iOS App Design Patters and Code Structuring) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I feel good today. I am working on an optional multiple choice quiz app project and I see a change in my thinking. I'm really happy about this. I feel that I will be able to solve this exercise. Either way, I am ecstatic to experience the growth in my analytical and problem solving skills.

## Day 24: Sunday, April 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started section 10 (iOS App Design Pattern Challenge) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling good about my progress, today. I'm so happy I completed the optional multiple choice quiz project. It helped to prepare me for this and gave me a resource to review when I got stuck. So far so good. The more I work through it, the better I understand structures.

## Day 25: Monday, April 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued section 10 (iOS App Design Pattern Challenge) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I made it to step 4 today. I'm feeling really good, because I thought I wouldn't figure out step 3. Yet, I did. I need to think and plan for step 4. I started it, but I'm missing something so far. I'll sleep on it and start off fresh again tomorrow.

## Day 26: Tuesday, April 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued section 10 (iOS App Design Pattern Challenge) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I figured out the previous issues, so now I'm almost done with step 5. My brain is content for tonight.

## Day 27: Thursday, April 21, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued section 10 (iOS App Design Pattern Challenge) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I struggled through tonight. I was even a bit more confused after starting, stopping and having previously moved some of the code from the view controller to the story brain file. I felt it was time to move on. I pulled down and scanned the code for direction and I saw that I was making it way more complex than it had to be. My mind is blown.

## Day 28: Thursday, April 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started section 11 (Advanced Swift Programming - Classes, Inheritance & Advanced Optionals) of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** So, I had to do a double take after reading "Advanced" in the  title to this section. I don't know hos I got here so soon. It feels quick, but maybe time flies when you're having fun. I still have many sections to go, but it feels good to progress. Today's lesson was on UISliders. However, the bigger less was to get over the pre-fear and intimidation I feel surrounding coding and exercises. It's proven that I feel that way until I get started. It's like I have 2 different hormones releasing. The first one that I could likely avoid or at least shorten by getting right down to business. And the second, good feeling that comes when I start coding.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
