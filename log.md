# 100 Days Of Code Log - [K. Marie Brown](https://github.com/KMarieBrown)

## Day 1: Saturday, March 12, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 1 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (variables, constants, strings, and numbers) and Section 1 of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp (Getting Started with iOS Development and Swift 5).

**Thoughts:** Not bad for day 1. Having some programming experience, today's topics were more familiar to me than not. It's interesting to see the differences between languages. I particularly liked that we can use underscores for thousands in Swift, in order to read numbers clearer. I also like that Swift is a type safe language that keeps you from mixing different data types by accident.

## Day 2: Sunday, March 13, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Day 2 of 100 Days of SwiftUI (Booleans, string interpolation, and checkpoint 1) and began Section 2 of Udemy's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp (Xcode Storyboards and Interface Builder).

**Thoughts:** Today was exciting. I am so happy Dr. Yu took us on a walkthrough of Xcode. It really reminds me of using Adobe Creative Cloud, so my creative senses are jumping happily. It was fun to start designing the UI, also. Swift, was fun to learn today, also. I liked working with string interpolation. I completed my tests with 100% scores and completed the checkpoint.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
